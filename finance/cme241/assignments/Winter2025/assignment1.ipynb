    "## Question 1: Snakes and Ladders (Led by ______)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classic childhood game of Snakes and Ladders, all players start to the left of square 1 (call this position 0) and roll a 6-sided die to represent the number of squares they can move forward. The goal is to reach square 100 as quickly as possible. Landing on the bottom rung of a ladder allows for an automatic free-pass to climb, e.g. square 4 sends you directly to 14; whereas landing on a snake's head forces one to slide all the way to the tail, e.g. square 34 sends you to 6. Note, this game can be viewed as a Markov Process, where the outcome is only depedent on the current state and not the prior trajectory. In this question, we will ask you to both formally describe the Markov Process that describes this game, followed by coding up a version of the game to get familiar with the RL-book libraries.\n",
